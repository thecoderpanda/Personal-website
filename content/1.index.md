# TheCoderPanda

Hi, I'm Shantanu Vishwanadha! I have 4 years of experience building relationships with investors and developers across the globe.

I've launched over 10 products internationally and built developer communities of 30,000+ members. I love to talk shop about blockchain, cloud computing, and developer relations.

Currently, I work as a Head of Devrel and Engineering at Lumos Labs. I'm a software engineer proficient in JavaScript, Python, Rust, and Go.

In past lives, I founded 3 startups and shipped robust products to many happy clients.

Collaborating with developers to solve problems is my jam. If I'm not coding, you can probably find me chuckling at memes on Reddit.

I like to unwind by writing poetry and whipping up the occasional smart contract.

Let's connect! I'd love to hear about the cool projects you're working on.

## Current Hustles: 
- Building a Developer Relations Suite for Companies to track their developer activities and engagements.
